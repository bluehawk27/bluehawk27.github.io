			<h3>Goalkeeper training 101</h3>
			<p>  Being a soccer goal keeper is one of the most mentally and emotionaly demanding positions in sports.  You are asked to be the last line of defense for your entire team.  Your failures are highlighted and your success is written off as being a part of your job.  There are two key ingredients that every beginner should know when starting this position.</p><br>

		    <p>  The first item that every keeper should be aware of when starting off is positioning.  Most of what keepers do is based off of proper positioning.  The angle of attack of an opposing player will determin your positioning in the box as illustrated by the figure above.  The red dots indicate your relative positioning in each scenario.</p>

		    <p>The other crucial aspiring goal keepers should take into consideration is the mental aspect of the position.  Most people will beat themselves up for allowing a goal.  You must remember that this is a team sport, and as such the burden is not yours alone.  The opposing team had to work their way through 10 other players before landing in your area.  It was a team failure.  That being said it is your responsibility to cover every angle possible and bust some Tim Howard type moves to highlight your play and keep your team in the game.</p>
