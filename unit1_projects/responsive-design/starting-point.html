        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
        <p>According to <em>Girl Develop It</em>, Responsive Design is, "Design by thinking of the structure of your website, and how different elements fit into the structure."<sup>1</sup> It is used to solve the issue of viewability of a web site on a multitude of different screen types, from mobile browsers to extremely large, flat-panel displays, because creating a different version of a website for every type of screen size is not practical.<sup>2</sup> A few of the factors that developers must consider when designing a site are: 
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Screen resolution</li>
            <li>Browser choice</li>
            <li>If the browser maximized, or not</li>
            <li>Accessibility issue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These factors make a "one-size-fits-all" layout virtually impossible these days. Responsive Design gives us the tools to tackle the planning of our site to help meet our objective of the best overall usability across devices.<sup>3</sup></p>

        <h4>Fluid Layouts</h4>
        <p>Fluid layouts use percentage as a width so they tend to fill the entire width of a browser adjusting to the users set up. It can also eliminate having to horizontally scroll for users.  Also, the extra white space between browsers and resolutions tends to be similar.</p>
        <p>The developer needs to adjust media and other content with set widths to compensate for different screen resolutions.<sup>4</sup></p>

      <div class="your-conclusion">
        <h4>Conclusion: Purpose and Practicality</h4>
        <p>The purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts is to provide viewablitly and functionality aross a wide range of devices with a large variation in screen size. Although developers have less control over testing for all environments, the use of responsive design provides for better utility of a site over many devices without having to create different sites for every one of them.  
        </p>
        <p>Although at times, fluid layouts are not the best solution for a site. It is a beneficial style to implent for the functionality of many sites today. It is practical and we believe its use will only increase as new technologies require it.</p>

        <h4>Individual Reflection</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
          <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
          <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
          <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>It was a lot of fun to impliment some responsive design into a site.  It was aslo great seeing how it changed and how it could be manipulated.</p>
        <p>Mobile and tablet devices have added another dimension to web design.  Designers/developers must now take into account how people are using the devices to make a user experience that flows and is easy to work with.  On the horizon the technology that will need to be considered is wearables and how they interact with the user and devices.</p>
        <p>Visually impared people use devices such as text readers to use and interact with the web.  They should definitly be taken into consideration when designing and developing to make an all inclusive experience.</p>
        <p>The idea of taking extra steps to make sure that everyone can enjoy the web has resonated with me.  I'm glad that it has been taken into consideration and that people activley work to improve that part of the web.</p>
        <p>Compatibility between browsers doesn't make sense to me.  Why isn't there a base standard that all browsers must adhere to?  I can understand screen issues but I'm a little confused with browser standardization.</p>
