            <h3>Conflicts</h3>
            <p>So in my earlier years I was a bit of a hot head and my passive aggressive nature along with my dry sarcasm led to a lot of conflicts with a lot of people. They were emotional and intellectual conflicts.  This would especially manifest itself when I would experience percieved injustices.</p>
            <p>At one point in my younger years, while I was in college, the fraternity that I belonged to decided to engage in a community outreach program.  We were all tasked with finding a local cause and reporting back the next week.  This sounded like a great idea!  We were all super stoked and went out to look for opportunities to serve.</p>
            <p>We all came back and had narrowed the selection to two different projects that each had merits.  The first one was a city clean up that would work by having us serve 1 weekend a month doing a highway clean up.  The second was the one I was most excited about.  It was an opportunity to serve at-risk youth in the area, guiding high school teenagers towards college.  Sadly, the votes came down on the side of the clean up.  It was easy for college students and didn't involve a time committment into people, which made it attractive for some of the members.  I was furious!</p>
            <p>I went on a rant and refused to attend any of the service hours.  This led to being disciplinary action by the Board and some of my rights, being stripped.  I went on to mentor on my own and refused to participate in mandatory fraternal events.  I was so caught up in my ideal of the right thing to do that I gave up on everything else that I had committed myself to with my friends.  I was given an opportunity to make things right and apologize for my actions but I refused.  We sat in one particular meeting where the fraternity pleaded with me for three hours to write an apology letter.  After that, all would be forgiven.  I absolutley refused.</p>
            <p>My actions that day made matters worse.  I stopped coming around fraternal events and I do think I missed out on some of my college experience.  Reflecting on that I would have tried to negotiate a way of still doing the community service event that I felt in my heart would have had a greater effect.  I saw things as black and white, and that things had to be done either one way or another.  </p>
