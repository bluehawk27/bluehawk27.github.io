      <h2>Week 4 Cultural:</h2>

        <h3>Cultural Diversity</h3>
          <p>One of the major issues, that has come to light in reports published by some of the largest tech companies in the valley, is the lack of cultural diversity. The following reports from <a href="http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html#tab=tech">Google</a>, <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/06/building-a-more-diverse-facebook/">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/89085398949/workforce-diversity-at-yahoo">Yahoo!</a> paints a picture that underscores the need to improve the diversity in the tech workforce.</p>

          <p>As you can see the reports for the tech sector of each company are nearly identical with Caucasian and males far out-pacing most other groups in the sector. A look at all other divisions of each company shows that the problem is not company wide, rather specific to the tech portion of the companies. So what causes the disparity in the tech sector as a whole?</p>

          <p>Most believe that is due to a lack of emphasis in the STEM subjects early in the academic career of our students. The workforce for each group roughly represents the same CompSci Degree trends. Another reason for the lack of diversity that is pointed out in the reports is the “brogrammer” culture amongst hiring managers in the tech companies. Meaning that they tend to hire people that they would want to work with or can more easily relate with.</p>

          <p>So how do we attack a problem that seems to be rooted in both the academic world, and in the hiring practices of the the very tech companies that seek this change?</p>

          <p>There have been introductory computer science courses in schools for the past 30 years. So what’s missing the these courses that they don’t convey the message that they are meant to communicate? They fail to build excitement and fail to show the real world applications in my opinion. As end users kids use these technologies almost every waking moment they need to be taught in lessons where they can quickly deploy basic and functional applications. High school students are highly relational and can gain an appreciation for pairing and group projects a lot easier than adults, that bring baggage to the equation</p>

          <p>As for tech companies the only thing that I can suggestion, without knowing or having been in the culture, would be to possibly diversify the pool of hiring managers within their respective departments.</p>
