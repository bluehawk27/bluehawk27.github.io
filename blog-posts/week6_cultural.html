					<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3> 
					
					<!--In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it-->
					<p>Claude M. Steele describes "Stereotype threat" as, a position people can put themselves in when they feel that any action they take can confirm negative stereotypes about their social group.  There are many racially charged examples of this in our society today, and they are sometimes purpetuated by media and social media.  An example is a recent <a href="http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html">trend</a> that went viral to exemplify that asked this question.  The basic premis being the question "How will society view me if I act or dress a certain way that reinforces basic stereotypes about the group I'm in?</p>
					<p>Have I experienced this as a latino in California? I certainly have.  My "group" is the target of illegal immigration discussion on a daily basis.  I've been asked, "Do you even speak english?", and have been questioned on my immigration status.  With incidents like those occuring every so often, I have taken precautions, in the past, to look or speak a certain way in an effort to project an image that wont be categorized into a negative stereotype.  As I've grown up I have realized that I really don't care about others negative perceptions of me as long as I can look myself in the mirror and know that I've either helped someone or tried to build something that is meaningful.</p>
					<p>The best way that I have found to deal with this is to point not take myself or others too seriously.  I find that if I can joke about the stereotypes that can be infered by my looks then I can break down barriers and educate ignorant perceptions by giving others something to think about.  Although, I am finding that there is less of a need to do this in the past decade.  This has helped me to put this "stereotype threat" aside.  I can't say I really feel it at all anymore, and I generally don't care to indulge in discussions about a "groups" ability to perform any given task. </p>
