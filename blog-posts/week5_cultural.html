					<h3>Pairing</h3> 
					<p>I have a great time pairing with others to accomplish/finish challenges.  I feel more productive in many ways.  The problems are solved quicker, and I'm not as easily distracated.  It also felt great going through a challenge and coding without having to refer to doing too much in the way of searches.  Like I'm finally learning or accomplishing something.  Pairing removes a lot of the frustrations of learning alone especially when I feel like I've hit a wall.</p>

					<h3>Feedback</h3>
					<p>I was able to read through the feedback that I have received yesterday.  It seems like I tend to minimize the value that I bring to my peer pairing sessions.  All of those little negative self talk voices had me feeling inadequet, but as the sessions progressed I noticed a certain comfort level developing.</p>  
					<p>It seems that I do need to speak up more when things start going a little off track.  I tend to let us go in the wrong direction with the assumption that my pair knows way more than I do and that they have a better method in mind.  Receiving feedback will help me better work with peers in the future, and being able to give people that sam opportunity to improve feels great.</p>
