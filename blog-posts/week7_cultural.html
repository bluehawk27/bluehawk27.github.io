					<h3>Values</h3> 
					<p>Living your life with integrity and having the courage to stick to it is among the most difficult values that you can work to uphold in your life.  It's easy to try to dismiss it when things get rough and hard to re-establish once you are known as lacking in it.  Having integrity and being known for it allows the flow of trust, respect, control, courage, personal development, honesty and many other attributes that I would love to be known for.  When you can maintain your integrity when no one is looking or when it would be easy to skirt the hard path, you've achieved something to be proud of.  That is something I strive for everyday.  It's not always easy and not always accomplished but when you can stop yourself and recognize/own your failures, then you have achieved a measure of personal growth.  So even in your failures you can strive to grow.</p>
					<p>Drawing on my values to deal with stereo type threat helps me by realizing that no matter of race or socio-economic status we all deal with integrity, or the lackthere of, at some point in our lives.  No matter the issue/person/bank account status/intellect we all run into situations that test our resolve and our integrity.  The real questions are: when will you break? and will you have the courage to acknowledge it?</p>
