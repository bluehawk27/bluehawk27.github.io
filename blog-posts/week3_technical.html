					<h3>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h3> 
								<p>JavaScript is popular because it’s easy to learn, and as a part of a site allows client side scripts to interact with users.</p>  
								
					<h3>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h3>
								<p>Some great attributes to Javascript are that it runs in the clients browser where the pages are being viewed.  This allows for quicker load times.   It is also now being used in many other applications such as server side programming (Node.js), mobile/web applications and in games.</p>
					<h3>What are its limitations?</h3>
								<p>JavaScript can’t access anything outside of the browser page that it is running on even if it is running on the clients computer (which is good for security concerns).  Another limitation due security concerns is that JS can’t close a window that it didn’t open. JavaScript by itself also can’t access web pages from a different domain.  This helps to protect private information between domains.  Also, JavaScript can’t protect your image or page sources once they have been decrypted by the clients computer. So asking for sensitive information on the client side only is a very bad idea.  Also, since the source code is being sent to the clients browser your code can be copied and manipulated.</p>
