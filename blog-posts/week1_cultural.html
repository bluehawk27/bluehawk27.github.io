			<h3>Cultural Article</h3>
			<p>  Dev bootcamp seems a lot like real bootcamp in that there will be tons of work,and you will fail, and you are expected to fail.  But you are failing in an environment where that is ok as long as you are open about it and asking for help and pursuing the knowledge.</p>

			<p>  The restraunt vs kitchen mentality is a great example of taking ownership of your education and that of others as well.  Working as a team and lifting eachother up is something that the military teaches.  Ownership and accountability are the differentiators in both mentalities.</p>

			<p>  Having said that I am extremely excited about attending Dev Bootcamp but also nervous.  As a complete newb, I have never touched a line of code before this week and it showed.  I made a few time mistakes and technical mistakes that set me back, but persistance is key.</p>
