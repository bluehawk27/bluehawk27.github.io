					<h3>Array Vs. Hash: Whats The Difference & When Should I Use Each?</h3> 
								  
								
					<h3>Arrays</h3>
								<p>Arrays-arrays store information in indicies in order the first one in the array is indexed at 0 and counts up from there.  The following is an array of numbers with their appropriate locations.  They can store different objects such as strings, other arrays, numbers, booleans, and other objects. Array = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</p>
					<h3>Hash's</h3>
								<p>Hashes-Hashes store information as key-value pairs.  Hashes aren’t ordered as they aren’t indexed by their position in the hash, and rather by their key which points to the value.  As such, access to the information that needs retrieving can be searched via the key.Hash = {key=>value, ‘ford’=>’mustang’, ‘chevrolet’=>’camaro’}</p>
					<h3>When To Use Each</h3>
								<p>From doing some reading and research Hashes seem to be the prefered method of implementation from a performance standpoint.  Hash look ups use the key to access the value and it generally takes a constant time to do the seach.  However arrays could be the better choice if you need to iterate through the data.</p>
