			<p>I like getting the news from this site.  I think they did a great job with the header on this site, and my attention is immediately drawn to it.  When I step back I am drawn to the huge image that they post daily/hourly.  The most important part of the site is further down where all the top news stories are, since they are in the business of delivering news.  I would describe the site as a little cluttered, it doesn’t flow well visually past the top, undefined, not labeled well, but I like the colors.  USA today is a news outlet.  I tend to think of it as close to unbiased reporting as I can get.  The site provides news across a broad spectrum of subjects, and it is updated quickly as the news develops so most of the links and captions must be dynamic.  The top navigation section makes it very easy to find most subjects across all the pages, but it is hard to navigate around the site beyond that.  Browsing through the site can easily be done with the top navigation section.  I feel more informed after visiting this site.  They do sell a subscription, and I haven’t purchased it because they haven’t made a compelling reason for that.   </p><br>

		    <p>  I like going to this site for technical assistance on different aspects of my car racing hobby.   On this site my eyes are drawn to the bottom of the screen where there are more images leading down.   Further back the main name catches my attention its huge and the brightest part of the initial site.  This site is bright, busy, organized, informative, and simple to navigate.  This website empowers DIY’s/owners, of a certain brand of vehicles, to make racing a hobby.  The content of the site is silly, fun, practical, opinionated, and informative.  Its very easy to scroll down and get to a section that you want, however navigating from that section to another is a bit cumbersome.  It’s better to go back to the homepage.  There is an enormous amount of information that is catagorized on this site.  It would take a very long time to go through all of the posts.  I definitely feel more informed after I come to this site and use it as a starting point for any mechanical/electrical work I intend on doing.  This site sells apparel however I have not purchased.  I don’t see the need to pay to promote their site.</p>

		    <p>Surprisingly enough I like going to the yahoo main page as well it provides a good list of news.  Unfortunately, initially my eyes are drawn to the huge pop up ad that they like putting up which is a bit intrusive.  After that and standing back i am drawn to the top large picture with the horizontally scrollable news feed below it.  That area of the site is important as it engages the viewer into staying longer, which is important to any portal.  Visually it offers a clean, simple, easy to visually navigate site that is easy on the eyes.  This site offers news from various categories and puts one from each on the front page.  As a portal it also offers different internet hosting/email solutions as well.  Yahoo offers entertaining, serious, whimsical, informative, and gossip news stories that interests people across a broad spectrum.  The site is easy to navigate from page to page.  It offers a sidebar and footer area with more news stories so you can jump from one to the other without having to revert back to the home page.   I usually feel like the site has sucked up a bunch of my time because it offers too much celebrity gossip in my opinion.  So sifting through that to get to great news stories can consume time.   Yahoo sells tons of web services.  I have purchased the domain and hosting service for a period of 2 years.</p>
