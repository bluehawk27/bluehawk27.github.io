				<h2>Week 2 Technical</h2>
					<p>On most pages you visit areas are divided into elements.  These different elements can be positioned on the website in different ways.  We call this positioning.  Giving your emelents the following positioning attributes also introduces the ability to stack your elements along the z-index.  Meaning that you can stack them on top of eachother.</p>
					<h3>Relative Postioning</h3> 
								<p>With relative positioning you are setting the positioning of the element relative to <b>itself</b>, not to other elements of the site. Meaning if you change the position, by giving it a bottom: 20px, it will move the element 20px up from the lower position of the element.
								<p>Relative positioning of a block also contains the changes of an absolutely positioned child element.  This allows the posibility of moving the absolutly positioned element inside of the the relatively positioned parent element.  How cool can that get?!</p>
					<h3>Absolute Positiong</h3>
								<p>Absolute positioning allows you to position any element you chose exactly where you want to place it within a parent element or html file if no parent exists yet.  The downside to this is that the element will not affect or be affected by the other elements.  This in turn can limit the flexability of the site.</p>
					<h3>Fixed Positioning</h3>
								<p>This positioning type allows the element to be fixed to the browser view itself so it stays put.  For example if you scroll it stays viewable and does not change as you scroll through the page.  It is a positioning style that isnt used as much and should be testing with different browsers/devices' compatibility.</p>
