					<h3>Classes</h3> 
								  
								
					<h3>When</h3>
								<p>Classes should be used for things that don't operate on an individual instance of a model.  Our real world example should help clarify this concept</p>
					<h3>Why</h3>
								<p>Classes are objects within Ruby that can hold methods for manipulating objects.  This allows you to create a class "cars" with some built in methods that systemize the components that you want to create/describe.</p>
					<h3>How?</h3>
								<p>Classes are created via the class keyword where you can then add a name to it.  Naming is conventionally done using CamelCase (ie. class BoggleBoard). </p>
					<h3>Real life example</h3>
								<p>OK so what would a real life example of a class look like and how would it get broken down? We'll start from the top and work our way down for this one.  We'll be using something you all know for this example</p>
								<p>Today we'll be starting off with your Class which is a car.  A car has many components that come together to make it what it is.  You have the engine, transmission, tires, wheels, seats.  We'll keep it to those short examples and we will call these your built in methods that describe this car.</p>
								<p>OK now that you have your <i>class Car</i> you can give it the built in methods of engine, transmission, tires, wheels, seats via instance or class variables depending on how you plan to access that information.</p>
								<p>pictures with more info to come........</p>
