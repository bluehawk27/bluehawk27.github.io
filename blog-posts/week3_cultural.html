            <h3>What is my thinking style?</h3>
            <p>As an Abstract sequential thinker it generally helps me to learn the intricacies of any new subject matter if I know the overall picture first. I like knowing the general theory of how the body of a subject matter before before delving into the finer points. As such, I generally don’t do was well starting with basic concepts without looking at the overall body of work. This caused the first 2 weeks of Dev Bootcamp to be somewhat of a struggle. I did change my self learning style to learn as much of each subject matter entirely before delving into the challenges. They certainly made more sense and was much more comfortable for me.</p>

            <p>In order to adapt to this environment I’ll have to either do some advanced research or learn to break things down to fundamentals, and stretch my thinking style.</p>
