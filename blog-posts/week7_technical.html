      <h2>Week 7 Technical:</h2>

        <h3>SQL vs NoSQL</h3>
          <p>SQL and NoSQL are two very distinct methods for storing data. Each has a following and advocacy for its uses and implimentation. So which one is better for your intended use?</p>
          <p>SQL or relational databases (RDBMS, Relational Database Management System) is the established DB structure that has been around for a very long time. It is a table based system with rows and columns, much like excel. And they store data much the same way. SQL uses a Structured Query Language for defining and manipulating data, and runs very much the same way across all the vendors. As such SQL works great for complex queries as sql has a standard interface which maintains integrity and order. SQL also excels with high transactional based applications for those same reasons. SQL is vertically scalable meaning that in order to manage increased load you can increase the CPU, SSD, RAM, etc on a single server. As initially mentioned, because of the widespread use and length of service of the technology, support is readily available and there are many consultants that can help with the deployment on any given project.</p>
          <p>NoSQL is the new kid on the block and has gained a following for its scalability(horizontal), which can be handled by simply bringing more servers online to handle increased loads. This allows you to quickly scale up or down as traffic loads dictate. NoSQL databases follow the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistant, Available, Partition tolerance) the emphasis being on consistant and available especially in the absence of a partition. In general consistancy is sacrificed in favor of faster responses in a manner that is more scalable. NoSQL databases are prefered for big data due to the way it stores big data as key-value pairs(similar to a hash). Overall NoSQL also stores data as a collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide column stores. These do no have standard schema definitions that need to be followed. As such NoSQL query structures can vary.</p>
          <p>So which one should you impliment? It totally depends on what you are trying to accomplish. But recently google has developed a NoSQL solution that atempts to address a lot of the concerns that the SQL users bring to the table. So some questions to ask maybe: Do I have the expertize on staff? How adventerous am I willing to be? and is scalability a top priority at this point?</p>
