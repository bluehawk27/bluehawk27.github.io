## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


1.  You can create a repository  on Github by 1: Click on the repositories tab on your github control panel
                                              2: Now click on the green "new tab"
                                              3: Name and create a short description in the fields provided.
                                              4: Make public or private
                                              5: Click "Create"---end
                                              Clone
                                              1: On the right had side of the repository will be a close url or code. Copy                                                   that.
                                              2: Open your command terminal and open the file where you want to generate a                                                   clone.
                                              3: In your terminal type in the following: git clone copied_url----end

2.  Open source allows anyone to see how the program is written/works AND allows others to change or customize as they see fit for their needs.

3.  Open source can go either way depending on the application. I wouldn't want a bank to use open source software to     conduct transactions, but other tools that help improve lives might be great as open source projects such as linux.  Open source needs to be used responsibly.

4.  Sets forth the terms and conditions for use of open source software, No stealing!

5.  Navigation around github was useful, cloning the repository did help me to see how changes can be made locally on my laptop and then loaded to github later.

6.  Yes, liceses!  I figured since something was open source then it was pretty much a free for all.  http://opensource.org/licenses
