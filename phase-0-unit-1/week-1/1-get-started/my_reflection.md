## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1.  Setting up git on my laptop was more of a challenge than understanding how to navigate and work around Github.  My move to a Macbook Pro after having worked exclusively with with PC's.  I learned how to work my way around the new lap top, and a lot about how the cmd terminal reacts in mac vs. pc's

2. Git vs. Github  
   Git is a version contronl management tool and can be used by teams to collaborate on projects without doing damage to the overall project without first testing your code.  It's also a tool that can be used to track changes you've made and creates a trail of sorts that can be used to reference the development of projects.
   Github is is hosting service for git repositories.

3. Version control is a way to track changes to any kind of file.  Instead of saving and overwriting existing files you can see previous versions of the same file to see how they have changed over time.  Github helps with this by creating an interface that is easy to use and navigate to deposit all of the repositories.

4. Developlers use version control to debug files and projects, and allows them to pinpoint when and were a change may have been made that caused issues.  They can also revert to previous versions of a file or project. 

5. I understand the use and reason for git hub and how to access and input commands in the terminal,  what I'm further researching and would like to further understand is the mechanism to push repositories from my terminal to github.
