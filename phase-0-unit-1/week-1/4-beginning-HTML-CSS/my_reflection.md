## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. HTML as the content providor makes sense and the tags are straight forward enough, but it will take time to learn all of the tags. What doesnt make sense to me yet is how the content is moved around on the page.  I know css has a hand in this but it is beyond me at this point.
2. The tags are labeled well to pick up quickly but the <div></div> as a way of labeling for CSS seems like it could clutter the code really fast.
3.  I had to watch a few youtube tutorials to pick up on how CSS is implimented and that helped a lot.  The instruction on CSS for a total newb like myself was a bit light.
Youtube various tutorials.
